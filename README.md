## Quick Access

- [Questionnaire Program](/questionnaire.sh)
- [Countdown Program](/countdown.sh)
- [Bingo Program](/bingo.sh)
- [Fortune Program](/fortune.sh)
- [Combining all 4 Programs](/combo.sh)

## Project Overview

These projects were built and tested inside a Gitpod-powered Linux command-line environment.
In the freeCodeCamp course [Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-scripting-by-building-five-programs/build-five-programs), I learn how to combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks. This course provides hands-on practice with terminal commands, conditional logic, loops, and functions to automate tasks on Linux systems.

Each of the five Bash scripts explores a different scripting concept:

- `questionnaire.sh`: Collects user input via prompts and prints formatted responses.
- `countdown.sh`: Runs a timed countdown in the terminal using loops and sleep.
- `bingo.sh`: Randomly generates a bingo-style number grid.
- `fortune.sh`: Delivers a random fortune or quote using arrays or file input.
- `combo.sh`: A bundled script that runs all four programs in order.

## Usage Instructions

Run any script using the Bash command:

```bash
bash scriptname.sh
```
